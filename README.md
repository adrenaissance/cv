# Alex D'agostino Aleksandrov - FS/IoT/Devops

## About Me
I am passionate about **hardware**, **software**, and **automation** — especially the intersection where they all meet. 
Throughout my career, I’ve worked in **hybrid** roles that bridge **software development** and **DevOps**, allowing me to follow the entire lifecycle of an IoT or web product.
From designing and building the client-facing applications (**frontend**) to developing the API and business logic layers (**backend**), and all the way to deploying and maintaining the underlying infrastructure, I’ve been involved in every step of the process.
I have extensive hands-on experience in cloud-native environments, working with tools such as **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **Argo CD**, and **OpenShift**, as well as with cloud provider ecosystems like **Azure DevOps**. This background enables me to design, build, and automate reliable, scalable systems end to end.
