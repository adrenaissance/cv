# Alex D'agostino Aleksandrov - Web developer

## About Me
I am passionate about **hardware**, **software**, and **automation** — especially the intersection where they all meet. 
Throughout my career, I’ve worked in **hybrid** roles that bridge **software development** and **DevOps**, allowing me to follow the entire lifecycle of an IoT or (pure) web product.
From designing and building the client-facing applications (**frontend**) to developing the API and business logic layers (**backend**), and all the way to deploying and maintaining the underlying infrastructure, I’ve been involved in every step of the process.
