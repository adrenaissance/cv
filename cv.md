# Alex D'agostino Aleksandrov - IoT Developer

## About Me
I've been captivated by the world of IoT for years - fascinated by the silent conversations happening behind the scenes between devices, microservices, and infrastructure. I love building the invisible layers that bring everyday products to life.
